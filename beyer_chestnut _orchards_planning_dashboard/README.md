# Beyer Chestnut Orchards Planning Dashboard

## Project Overview:

- **Tableau Dashboard**
  - I built a high-level overview dashboard to accompany a suite of tools for my father's hobby chestnut farm.  The dashboard gives my father insight into avg. cost per variety, death rates, yearly plantings and deaths so he can better plan for next years and understand how many trees he should be replacing and which variety will do best.
