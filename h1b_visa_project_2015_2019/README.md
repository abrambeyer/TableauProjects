# H1B Visa Projects

## Project Overview:

- **Tableau Dashboard 1** 
  - Built first Tableau dashboard using pre-wrangled data from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com).  [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa).  Inspired by Sharan Naribole's initial data submission.
- **Tableau Dashboard 2**
  - *Data Collection*:  Updated the Kaggle dataset to new time period.  The original dataset was old (2011-2015).  I wrote my own R code to perform the same data collection for the time period 2015-2019.  This involved heavily updating the original R code from kaggle in order to wrangle the new time period.

  - *Data cleaning*:  Collected the data, joined multiple data files, filtered and engineered features using dplyr syntax.  Tidying the dataset included probabilistic correction of location data.
  - New dashboard design on Tableau Public for the new dataset.
