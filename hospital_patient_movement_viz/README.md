# Hospital Patient Movement Viz

## Project Overview:

- **Tableau Dashboard** 
  - This dashboard project was first motivated by a need to potentially track *where* patients go throughout their stay in the hospital.  To give operations managers a high level view of tracking items such as patient satisfaction and certain patient conditions.  The hope is to give operations leaders an idea of certain pathway trends that lead to patient satisfaction/disatisfaction.  Tracking patient conditions has become increasingly important with the COVID pandemic as patients sometimes test positive after moving to several units in the hospital and the need to quarantine all providers who come in contact with those patients.  
  
## Tools Used In This Project
- **Microsoft SQL Server:** 2016
- **Excel**
- **Tableau** 2020.1.4
- **Vectr.com**
 

## Data Prep and Query
- Wrote a T-SQL query to simulate hospital patient movement.
- In T-SQL, wrote logic for Tableau point jitter.  [Thanks to http://drawingwithnumbers.artisart.org for the waffle jitter inspiration](http://drawingwithnumbers.artisart.org/waffle-charts-and-unit-charts-on-maps/)
- Exported final dataset to Excel
- Visualize in Tableau
- Background image created with [Vectr.com](https://vectr.com/user-guide/)
